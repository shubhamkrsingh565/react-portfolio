# Overview of Project

## Developer Portfolio

### Objective: 
Developed a comprehensive developer portfolio to showcase proficiency in front-end technologies and \
design principles, aiming to present a user-friendly and responsive experience across devices.

### Technologies & Skills Utilized:

`React:` Leveraged React.js to build a dynamic and interactive user interface, ensuring efficient\
component rendering and state management.

`useState Hook:` Implemented the useState hook within React for managing component-level state,\
enabling dynamic content updates without full-page reloads.

`EmailJS:` Integrated EmailJS to facilitate seamless communication, allowing visitors to send inquiries\
directly from the portfolio website to designated email addresses.

`Responsive Design with CSS3:` Employed CSS3 media queries and flexible grid layouts to ensure optimal\
viewing experience across various screen sizes and devices.

`Carousels/Slides with SwiperJS:` Utilized SwiperJS library to create engaging carousels and slides,\
enhancing content presentation and user engagement.

### Key Features:

* Designed a visually appealing and user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
* Implemented responsive layouts to ensure compatibility and optimal viewing across desktop, tablet,\
   and mobile devices.
  
* Integrated EmailJS functionality for users to easily send messages or inquiries directly from the portfolio website.
* Incorporated SwiperJS carousels/slides to showcase projects, skills, or testimonials in an interactive manner.
* Optimized performance and user experience through efficient state management and component rendering\
  with React and useState hook.

### Outcome: 
Successfully developed and deployed a developer portfolio showcasing technical skills, projects, and experiences,\
demonstrating expertise in React, responsive design, state management, and interactive UI/UX components.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
